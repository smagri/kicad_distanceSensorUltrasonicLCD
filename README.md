This  is a  KiCad schematic  and  PCB design  that was  produced as  a
project to learn KiCad.

It is a distance sensor using a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and
displaying the the distance on a 1602LCD.  See images/ directroy, no
enclosure has yet been made.

PCB was manufactured by pcbway.com.



It was  originally produced to  be part  of the illabunda  eco village
Water Control System private project.  However, the design can be used
a general ultrasonic  sensor based as an  approximate distance measure
from 2cm - 400cm.  There are new plans for a PyDroid3 python based TCP
network RF version to be created now.
